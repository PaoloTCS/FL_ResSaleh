# Delaunay Triangulations in Fundamental Language (FL) Research

## Introduction
In this notebook, we focus on Delaunay triangulations and their connection to Voronoi diagrams in the context of FL research.

## Computing Delaunay Triangulations
We will demonstrate the computation of Delaunay triangulations using Python libraries and discuss their properties.

## Application in FL
Exploring the role of Delaunay triangulations in FL research and how they contribute to the understanding of various phenomena.
