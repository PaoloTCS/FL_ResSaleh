# Voronoi Diagrams in Fundamental Language (FL) Research

## Introduction
This notebook introduces Voronoi diagrams, a fundamental concept in the study of FL. We will explore how these diagrams can be generated and interpreted in the context of FL research.

## Creating Voronoi Diagrams
Here, we will use Python libraries to generate Voronoi diagrams and analyze their properties.

## Application in FL
Discussion on how Voronoi diagrams are utilized in FL research and their significance in understanding linguistic and physical phenomena.
