# Prime Number Encoding Scheme in FL Research

## Introduction
This notebook discusses the innovative encoding scheme using prime numbers for Voronoi cells in FL research.

## Implementing the Encoding Scheme
We will implement the encoding scheme, including Fortune's algorithm and the recursive generation of cell labels.

## Analysis and Application
Analyzing the implications of this encoding scheme in FL research and its potential applications in linguistic and physical studies.
